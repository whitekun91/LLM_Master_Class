with this Rule  5.\n5.2World Archery may conduct an investigation into the activities of any Participant that it believes may have committed a Violation\nof these Rules and may appoint one or more Persons for this purpose. Such investigation may be conducted in conjunction with\nrelevant competent national or international authorities (including criminal, administrative, professional and/or judicial\nauthorities) and all Participants must co-operate fully with such investigations. World Archery shall have discretion, where it\ndeems it appropriate, to stay its own investigation pending the outcome of investigations conducted by other competent\nauthorities.\n5.3As part of any such investigation, if  World Archery reasonably suspects that a Participant has committed a Violation of these\nRules, it may make a written demand to such Participant for information that is related to the alleged Violation and/or require the\nattendance of such Participant for interview, or a combination of the two. Any interview shall be at a time and place to be\ndetermined by World Archery and the relevant Participant shall be given reasonable notice in writing of the requirement to attend.\nInterviews shall be recorded and the Participant shall be entitled to have legal counsel and an interpreter present.\n5.4By participation in a Competition, each Participant shall be deemed to have agreed for the purposes of applicable data protection\nlaws and other laws, and for all other purposes, to have consented to the collection, processing, disclosure or any other use of\ninformation relating to the Participant's activities (including without limitation personal information) to the extent permitted\nunder these Rules and shall confirm such agreement in writing upon demand.\nIssuing a Notice of Charge\n6.1Where following an investigation World Archery determines that there is a case for the Participant to answer under Rule 3, World\nArchery shall issue the Participant with a written Notice of Charge setting out the following:\n(a) The specific Violation(s) that the Participant is alleged to have committed;\n(b) The facts upon which such allegation(s) are based;\n(c) The range of sanctions applicable under the Rules for such Violations;\n(d) Details relating to the Participant\u2019s response to the Notice of Charge within a specified deadline; and\n(e) The Participant\u2019s right to have the matter determined by a hearing.\n6.2The Notice of Charge shall also specify that, if the Participant wishes to exercise the right to a hearing, the Participant must\nsubmit a written request for a hearing so that it is received by World Archery as soon as possible but in any event within 14 days\nof receipt of the Notice of Charge. The request must state how the Participant responds to the charge and must explain (in\nsummary form) the basis for such response.\n6.3If the Participant fails to file a written request for a hearing by the specified deadline, the Participant shall be deemed to have:\n(a) waived the right to a hearing;\n(b) admitted to have committed the Violation(s) specified in the Notice of Charge; and\n(c) acceded to the range of applicable sanctions specified in the Notice of Charge.\n6.4Where the Participant requests a hearing in accordance with Rule 6.2 the matter shall proceed to a hearing in accordance with\nRule 7. Where the Participant is deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and to have admitted the Violation(s) in accordance\nwith Rule 6.3, a hearing shall be limited to determining the applicable sanctions only.\n6.5In any case where World Archery decides to charge a Participant with a violation under these Rules, it shall have discretion, in\ncircumstances where it considers that the integrity of the sport could otherwise be seriously undermined, to provisionally suspend\nthe Participant pending the Board of Justice and Ethic\u2019s determination of whether a Violation was committed. A provisional\nsuspension shall be effective from the date of notification to the Participant in accordance with these Rules. Alternatively, the\nParticipant may accept a voluntary suspension from competition provided that it is confirmed in writing toWorld Archery. A\nvoluntary suspension shall be effective only from the date of receipt of the Participant\u2019s written confirmation of such to World\nArchery.\n6.6A decision to impose a provisional suspension on a Participant shall not be subject to appeal.\n6.7If a Participant retires whilst a disciplinary procedure under these Rules is underway, World Archery and Board of Justice and\nEthics shall retain jurisdiction to complete the relevant procedure. If the Participant retires before any disciplinary procedure has\nbegun, World Archery and Board of Justice and Ethics shall nevertheless have jurisdiction to conduct the relevant procedure.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4982, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "741a0180-9052-43bc-ade5-75c2a2351b57": {"__data__": {"id_": "741a0180-9052-43bc-ade5-75c2a2351b57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "EN-Book1.pdf", "file_path": "..\\sample_data\\EN-Book1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 506993, "creation_date": "2024-08-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "544244ff-7b12-4c57-a334-4c2e94e7f1c4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "EN-Book1.pdf", "file_path": "..\\sample_data\\EN-Book1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 506993, "creation_date": "2024-08-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25"}, "hash": "2445d0ecd691d7525680890fe4ce1364944070baf39b44502d073eab83afb2c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d236de0-1723-4f0d-ba9c-2ce7d17a26e1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "EN-Book1.pdf", "file_path": "..\\sample_data\\EN-Book1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 506993, "creation_date": "2024-08-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25"}, "hash": "32166cbea2de350618006ea757083cb3871c8a48e955388381e3f2b631d7f028", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A provisional\nsuspension shall be effective from the date of notification to the Participant in accordance with these Rules.
